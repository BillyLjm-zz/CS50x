# CS50x Introduction to Computer Science

These are the problem sets I did as part of the CS50x MOOC.  
I have completed a previous run of this MOOC before in 2013. However, I might have already forgotten most of the C semantics due to disuse.  
No matter, I'll also be doing the harder "hacker editions" of the problem sets this time since I'm already familiar with programming in general.

__Date:__ 2015  
__School__ Harvard University  

## Description
Each file contains a week's problem sets & are separated into normal/hacker editions.  
`pset` - normal problem sets  
`hacker` - hacker editions (harder than their normal counterparts)  
The purpose of each program is written directly into each file.  
Instructions for the problem sets are linked below.
